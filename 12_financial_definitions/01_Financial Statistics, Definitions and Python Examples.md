## Mean (Average)
**Definition:**
The mean is the central value of a dataset. In finance, it often represents the average return of an asset over a period.

**Example:**
If an index returns 2%, 3%, and 5% over three months, the mean return is (2+3+5)/3 = 3.33%.

## Variance
**Definition:**
Variance measures how much the data points differ from the mean. A high variance means returns fluctuate a lot.

**Use:**
Itâ€™s useful for understanding risk and volatility.

---

## Standard Deviation
**Definition:**
This is the square root of the variance. It tells you how spread out the returns are in the same units as the data.

**Use:**
In finance, itâ€™s often used to measure volatility.

## Covariance
**Definition:**
Covariance shows how two assets move together. If they tend to rise and fall together, covariance is positive.

**Use:**
Itâ€™s key for understanding relationships between assets in a portfolio.

## Correlation
**Definition:**
Correlation is a normalized version of covariance that ranges from -1 to +1.

**Interpretation:**
- +1: assets move perfectly together
- -1: assets move in opposite directions
- 0: no relationship

**Use:**
It helps assess diversification potential in a portfolio.
