# ðŸ“˜ Definitions

# Mean:
<!-- # The average value of a dataset. In finance, it often represents the average return of an asset.
# Example: If returns are [2%, 3%, 5%], the mean is (2+3+5)/3 = 3.33%. -->

# Variance:
# A measure of how much the returns deviate from the mean. Higher variance means more fluctuation.
# It helps assess the risk or volatility of an asset.

# Standard Deviation:
# The square root of the variance. It shows how spread out the returns are, in the same units.
# Commonly used to measure volatility in financial markets.

# Covariance:
# Indicates how two assets move together. A positive covariance means they tend to rise/fall together.
# Useful for understanding relationships between assets in a portfolio.

# Correlation:
# A normalized version of covariance that ranges from -1 to 1.
# +1 means assets move perfectly together, -1 means they move in opposite directions, and 0 means no relationship.
# It helps assess diversification potential.
